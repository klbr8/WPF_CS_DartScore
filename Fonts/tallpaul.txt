a note from the groom

"hello again,
tomorrow [august 16] is my wedding reception 
(we got "hitched" in ireland three weeks ago... 
new photos on the website next week) 
so it's a bit hectic here...  
i think it would be cool to have my font as part of your library, 
so sure... 
go ahead and post it!...
and let me know if people are actually downloading it !?!"
