# WPF_CS_DartScore

This windows app is for scoring live steel-tip dart games. As each real world dart lands on the board, the score keeper can click on the dartboard control in the matching location and the scoreboard will update with temporary score. After all darts for a round have been marked the accept score button will cause the scoreboard to change the score permanantly and reset the dartboard control for the next player.

Long term plans are to incorporate dart league management, player stat histories, mobile device versions of the dartboard control and screen casting of the scoreboard control. There are also a lot of projects working on camera score detection so, if I find a compatible library for that I would like to incorporate it as well.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! and wanted!

Obviously if you play and enjoy darts you will enjoy developing this project but it is not a requirement.

I am a hobbyist developer and this project currently has an amount of reasonably documented code that is navigable by beginner/hobbyist/amateur coders and you can definitely make an impact right away. 

Seasoned developers are desired as well to give insight on the projects codebase and direction (and to express how impressed they are with me, everyone can use a pep talk once in a while).

See `contributing.md` for ways to get started.

Please adhere to this project's `code of conduct`.
